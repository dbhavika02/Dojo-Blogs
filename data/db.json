      "body": "Tulip flowers make a great Spring addition to your garden at home! All tulip varieties do best in a full sun environment. With well-draining soil and compost your tulips will thrive. In regards to water, only water abundantly when they are first planted, after that you can withhold watering until there are long dry spells. In dryer regions, you can water them every two weeks.

Florida weather with excessive humidity and rain could cause bulbs to rot.",
